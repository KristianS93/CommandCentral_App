*Disclaimer: This project is only intended for 2 mobile devices in my household. 
The Commancentral App was created based on a problem I wanted to solve in my own household, my experience with mobile development is very limited, therefore a big part of this app is coded with prompt engineering, through chat gpt. Naturally, some parts has to be handled by me, but major parts of the ui is created by gpt.*
